Feature flags
=============

Features flags allow admins to enable or disable features for certain groups
of users. You can enable or disable them from the Administration Dashboard.

To access the Administration Dashboard, you will need to first create a
user account in your local instance of H and then give that account
admin access rights using H's command-line tools.

See the :doc:`/developing/administration` documentation for information
on how to give the initial user admin rights and access the Administration
Dashboard.
